# Sorting Algorithms

This project implements several sorting algorithms in C, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

## Requirements

- C89 standard
- No use of standard libraries for output (e.g., printf)

## Functions

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own source file, and their prototypes are defined in `sort.h`.

## Usage

To use the sorting algorithms, include the `sort.h` header file and compile the necessary source files together.
